# SourceTree, Atom integration

Make sure that the latest GIT is installed (https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/blob/main/ReleaseNotes.md#changes-since-git-for-windows-v2280-july-28th-2020)

Ensure that SourceTree isn't using the imbedded GIT; this is a setting on the GIT tab in options.

Then it should allow authentication through Windows
